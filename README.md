# JavaScript Loose Equality and Null/Undefined Comparisons

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript error related to loose equality (`==`) when dealing with `null` and `undefined` values.  Using strict equality (`===`) is generally recommended to avoid unexpected type coercion and improve code clarity and reliability.

## Bug Description
The `bug.js` file showcases a function that uses loose equality (`==`) to check for `null` values.  This can lead to unexpected behavior due to JavaScript's type coercion mechanisms.  The loose equality operator (`==`) does type coercion before comparison which can lead to unexpected results.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates the corrected function using strict equality (`===`).  Strict equality does not perform type coercion and provides a more predictable comparison, fixing the potential for unexpected behavior.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the `bug.js` file and run the code in a JavaScript environment.
3. Observe the outputs of `console.log` statements.
4. Compare the results with those from the corrected code in `bugSolution.js` to see the difference between loose and strict equality in handling `null` values.
